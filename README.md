## Steps necessary to run the software

To clone the repository to your local machine, open the terminal and run 'git clone https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/2-web-app-leodavejessalexangteamagain.git'. Use the 'cd' command to set the directory to the local repository. It is recommended to set a virtual environment with pipenv, which can be installed with the command 'pip install pipenv'. To activate the environment, run 'pipenv shell'. To install Flask and pymongo, run the commands 'pipenv install Flask' and 'pipenv install pymongo'. The comprehensive list of requirements is as follows:

bcrypt==4.2.0
blinker==1.8.2
click==8.1.7
dnspython==2.7.0
Flask==3.0.3
itsdangerous==2.2.0
Jinja2==3.1.4
MarkupSafe==3.0.1
pymongo==4.10.1
python-dotenv==1.0.1
Werkzeug==3.0.4

If using Visual Studio Code, navigate the search bar and enter '>Python: Select Interpreter' and click on the virtual environment created in the previous steps. Running app.py will output the local address where your Flask web application is running. The link can be copied and pasted to a web brower or those on Visual Studio Code can press the command key and click on the link.
